# Case-Converter

freeCodeCamp Practice Project.


Scientific Computing with Python.



List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.

In this project, I wrote a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.

The project has two phases: first I used a for loop to implement the program. Then you'll learn how to use List Comprehension instead of a loop to achieve the same results.
